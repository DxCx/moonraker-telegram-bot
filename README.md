The general idea of this project is to provide you with a way to control and monitor your printer without having to setup a vpn, opening your home network, or doing any sort of other network-related vodoo.
In addition you get the benefits of push-style notifications always in your pocket, and a bandwidth-friendly way to check up on your print progress, when not near the printer.

As always with solutions like these, we kindly remind you not to print unattended, and always to take all necessary precautions against fire hazards.
